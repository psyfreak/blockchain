supplyChain is ownable, mortal, accessible

## Description

## Design & UML

## 


## Additional remarks:
- Roles: Only oneself can remove a role, only so. with a specific role can add the same role to a new abitrary address.
- I am still unhappy about the old code
- Descriptions of projects are soso for example in requirement 1 you mentioned part A. I have no clue what part A means.
- State diagram vs UML State Diagram => I really like the diagram style, though  it is not UML standard
- Architecture vs. Code => What we actually do is reverseEngineering the diagram, which is nice, but not real planning.
- Contract inheritance => Core => Base => AccessControl.
