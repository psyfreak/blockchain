========= NOTICE =========
Request-Rate Exceeded  (this message will not be repeated)

The default API keys for each service are provided as a highly-throttled,
community resource for low-traffic projects and early prototyping.

While your application will continue to function, we highly recommended
signing up for your own API keys to improve performance, increase your
request rate/limit and enable other perks, such as metrics and advanced APIs.

### NFT Metadata Storage
For this tutorial, we will rely on IPFS and Protocol Lab's NFT Storage for metadata storage,
but you could consider other solution providers such as Arweave or Pinata if your needs
call for data permeance or ease-of-use.

####
The /images directory will store all our images, which we will need to upload 
first and /metadata will store all the JSON files for the tokens in your NFT
 contract and we will upload all of them at once as a compiled IPFS Car. 
 This ensures that they all have the same base endpoint with individual tokenIDs 
 appended at the end.

Had issues to upload and ifps-cars pack commands
need to update node to v16.x

#### CARS
A CAR is a Content Addressed Archive that allows you to pre-compute the root CID for your assets. You can pack your assets into a CAR with the ipfs-car cli or via https://car.ipfs.io.

Give your CAR filename the .car extention, and when
 it's uploaded to nft.storge your asset will be stored with the exact same root CID as defined in the CAR file.

The json image link holds the img link uploaded for a particular img.

# Dezentralized File-Systems

Content based addressing is the key difference to traditional web2 systems where location based addressing is used.
- IPFS / HASH-Value
- FOLDER / FOLDER / FILE

web2: /img/jo.png if you change jo.png you still have the same address based on the naming (or serving of the file/router).
web3: /img/49499f999.png if you change it youÂ´ll get a new address and therefore url is not the same anymore.
There are services to have the same URI.

If content moved in location based you get an 404 error.
